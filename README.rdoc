== BEERMATH

Beermath is a database calculates how much alcohol you can buy under specific criteria: price per ABV, price per calorie, price per ounce and similar. Each column on the index page is sortable. It has been modified to accept CSV files through a rake. Anyone can view the information but a user signup is required to manipulate records. 

Once a suitable source for local prices has been found (the author is currently in talk with two NC breweries as test cases), Beermath will support its own API.
